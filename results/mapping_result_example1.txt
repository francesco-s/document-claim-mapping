[4] [INTEREST_RATES]: "2024-12-20 04:19:55.430000: US 10-Year Yield Firms Up Ahead of PCE Inflation Data The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note remained near seven-month highs around 4.55% on Friday, as investors prepared for the latest PCE price index report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated this week that the PCE is likely to show the 12-month inflation rate remains above the central bank’s 2% target. His remarks followed the Fed’s widely anticipated quarter-point rate cut, although the central bank signaled fewer rate reductions in 2025 due to persistent inflation."

[5] [INFLATION]: "2024-12-20 13:46:27.470000: 10-Year Treasury Yield Drops from 7-Month High The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to below the 4.52% mark on Friday, pulling back from the week’s rally that lifted the yield to a near seven-month high as the latest inflation data favored the resumption of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Core PCE prices, which are the Fed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation, rose the least in six months in the November print."

[6] [ECONOMIC_DATA]: "2024-12-24 06:56:38.650000: US 10-Year Yield Stays Near 7-Month High Weaker economic data raised expectations that the Fed would implement fewer rate cuts next year. Disappointing US consumer confidence data and concerns over the potential worsening of the country’s fiscal outlook under President-elect Donald Trump led markets to adjust their expectations. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index for December fell to a three-month low of 104.7, down from 111.7 in November. Meanwhile, durable goods orders dropped 1.1% month-over-month in November, marking the third decline in the past four months."

[7] [GOV_BOND]: "2024-12-30 04:13:04.807000: US 10-Year Treasury Yield Holds Above 4.6% The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note remained above the 4.6% mark on Monday, sustaining its highest level since early May, amid expectations of more limited Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. Investors also pared debt holdings ahead of the year-end, adding upward pressure on yields. Recent data underscores the resilience of the US economy. Initial unemployment claims in mid-December were lower than expected, indicating a robust labor market, while strong retail sales and services activity highlighted healthy consumer demand. These trends align with FOMC projections that suggest the Fed will cut rates only twice by 25bps next year, prioritizing inflation control over labor market concerns. Meanwhile, inflation risks are magnified by President-elect Trump’s proposals for tariffs on key trading partners, tax cuts, and expansionary fiscal policies. Markets now price in just two rate cut for 2025, reflecting persistent inflation concerns and a cautious outlook on monetary easing."

Economic recovery is projected to be slower than before, with growth expected at 0.7% in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, and 1.4% in 2026."

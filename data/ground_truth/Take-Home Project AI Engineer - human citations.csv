1;the Federal Reserve cut rates to 4.25%-4.5%;"2024-12-18 19:01:06.427000: Fed Cuts Rates For 3rd Consecutive Time
The Fed announced another 25bps cut to the federal funds rate in December 2024, marking the third consecutive reduction this year and bringing borrowing costs to the 4.25%-4.5% range, in line with expectations. The so-called dot plot indicates that policymakers now anticipate just two rate cuts in 2025, totaling 50 basis points, compared to the full percentage point of reductions projected in the previous quarter. The Fed also revised its GDP growth forecasts upward for 2024 (2.5% vs to 2% in the September projection) and 2025 (2.1% vs 2%), while remaining steady at 2% for 2026. Similarly, PCE inflation projections have been adjusted higher for 2024 (2.4% vs 2.3%), 2025 (2.5% vs 2.1%), and 2026 (2.1% vs 2%). The same trend applies to core PCE inflation, with forecasts raised for 2024 (2.8% vs 2.6%), 2025 (2.5% vs 2.2%), and 2026 (2.2% vs 2%). On the other hand, unemployment is seen lower this year (4.2% vs 4.4%) and in 2025 (4.3% vs 4.4%) while the forecast was kept at 4.3% for 2026.

1;adjusted inflation forecasts higher;"2024-12-20 04:19:55.430000: US 10-Year Yield Firms Up Ahead of PCE Inflation Data
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note remained near seven-month highs around 4.55% on Friday, as investors prepared for the latest PCE price index report, the Federal Reserve�s preferred inflation measure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated this week that the PCE is likely to show the 12-month inflation rate remains above the central bank�s 2% target. His remarks followed the Fed�s widely anticipated quarter-point rate cut, although the central bank signaled fewer rate reductions in 2025 due to persistent inflation. The Fed now expects only two rate cuts next year, a sharp shift from its September forecast of four cuts. Additionally, the Fed revised its 2025 economic projections, raising GDP growth and inflation forecasts while lowering its unemployment rate outlook. As a result, markets are pricing in a 90% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged in January.

1;US 10-year Treasury yield fluctuated, peaking at 4.62%;"2024-12-26 04:30:49.460000: US 10-Year Yield Hits 7-Month High
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose to around 4.62%, hitting its highest level in almost seven months, as markets continued to assess the Federal Reserve�s monetary policy outlook following its hawkish projections last week. Median projections by FOMC members indicated that policymakers expect fewer rate cuts than previously anticipated. Weaker economic data, disappointing US consumer confidence, and concerns over Trump�s fiscal policies led markets to adjust their expectations for fewer Fed rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, inflation concerns were heightened by additional tariff threats from Trump, including barriers on Mexico, the EU, and China. Investors also moved away from the safety of bonds after the US government reached an agreement on a spending bill, preventing a late-year government shutdown. Investors are now awaiting the release of weekly jobless claims data later in the day.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Index inflation rose minimally;"2024-12-30 15:27:15.043000: US 10-Year Yield Falls 10bps
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note was at the 4.55% mark on Monday, falling nearly 10bps from the near seven-month high touched in the prior session as markets continued to assess the policy outlook for the Fed next year. Investors heeded hawkish signals penned by FOMC members in the latest dot plot amid upward revisions to projections on PCE inflation and the target funds rate, driving rate traders to only price two rate cuts next year. Still, uncertainty remains on whether the economy may drift into a backdrop that could warrant a higher magnitude of rate cuts. This was lastly underscored by the soft rise in core PCE inflation for November. Additionally, continuing unemployment claims rose to their highest in over three years halfway through December. For the whole year, the slow disinflation process in the US and pro-inflationary risk brought by President-elect Trump�s campaign drove the 10-year yield to rise 50bps in 2024.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note was little-changed at around 4.59% on Tuesday, remaining close to its near seven-month high as markets continued to assess the extent of rate cuts the Fed might implement in 2025, amid the holiday-shortened week. Weaker economic data raised expectations that the Fed would implement fewer rate cuts next year. Disappointing US consumer confidence data and concerns over the potential worsening of the country�s fiscal outlook under President-elect Donald Trump led markets to adjust their expectations. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index for December fell to a three-month low of 104.7, down from 111.7 in November. Meanwhile, durable goods orders dropped 1.1% month-over-month in November, marking the third decline in the past four months.

1;The European Central Bank cut rates to 3%;"2024-12-12 13:16:53.213000: ECB Cuts Rates by Another 25 bps as Expected
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to cut its key interest rates for the fourth time this year by 25 bps in December 2024, as expected. This move reflects a more favorable inflation outlook and improvements in monetary policy transmission. Inflation is expected to gradually decrease, with forecasts of 2.4% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. Core inflation, excluding energy and food, is also expected to fall, with a target of 2% in the medium term. Despite easing financing conditions due to the rate cuts, borrowing costs remain tight due to previous hikes still affecting existing loans. Economic recovery is projected to be slower than before, with growth expected at 0.7% in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, and 1.4% in 2026. The ECB remains focused on ensuring inflation returns to its 2% target and will adjust its policies based on incoming data, without committing to a fixed rate path.

Germany's 10-year Bund yield surged toward 2.4%, its highest in seven weeks, as investors believe the ECB will need to slow down interest rate cuts. Rising natural gas prices, partly due to uncertainty over Russian supplies through Ukraine, raised inflation concerns making it harder for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Markets now fully price in four quarter-point ECB rate cuts in 2025, with less than a 50% chance of a fifth cut, down sharply from over 80% a week ago. The shift follows hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, which dampened expectations for rapid rate easing. Yields have risen roughly 30 basis points in December, the biggest monthly jump since September 2023.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1;France's OAT reached 3.2%;"2024-12-27 13:45:43.617000: French 10-Year OAT Yield Rises Toward 4-Month High
The yield on the 10-year French OAT rose toward the 3.2% mark in December, the highest since touching a four-month high of 3.21% on November 7th as concerns of upside inflation risks for major economies limited the room for rate cuts by major central banks next year. The higher yield on US Treasuries continued to pressure government bonds across economies with exposure to US credit markets as tariff threats and stubborn underlying inflation drove a portion of the market to price in a single rate cut by the Fed next year. In turn, higher natural gas prices in Europe due to increasingly uncertain supply sources for next year raised the outlook for inflation in the Eurozone. Domestically, the fallout of political upheaval that led to Bayrou being named Prime Minister worsened concerns for the upcoming French deficits, driving Moody�s to downgrade the rating on French bonds. The spread of the 10-year OAT to Bund widened by 40bps this year, despite budget concerns in Germany.

Italy�s 10-year BTP yield surged above 3.50%, the highest level in over a month, mirroring other European peers, as traders considered the possibility of a slower pace of interest rate reductions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the coming year. Additionally, bets on ECB rate cuts were scaled back as concerns grew over higher natural gas prices, linked to uncertainty surrounding Russia's supplies and ongoing political instability, which could heighten inflation risks. Moreover, Europe is grappling with sluggish economic growth, amplifying its challenges. President-elect Trump's proposed tariffs pose significant risks to European export-driven industries, potentially deepening the region's economic slowdown.

The Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its key short-term interest rate at around 0.25% during its final meeting of the year, keeping it at the highest level since 2008 and meeting market consensus. The vote was split 8-1, with board member Naoki Tamura advocating for a 25bps increase. Thursday's decision came despite the US implementing its third rate cut this year, as the BoJ needed more time to assess certain risks, particularly US economic policies under Donald Trump and next year's wage outlook. The board adhered to its assessment that Japan's economy is on track for a moderate recovery, despite some areas of weakness. Private consumption continued its upward trend, aided by improving corporate profits and business spending. Meanwhile, exports and industrial output remained relatively flat. On inflation, the yoy figures have ranged between 2.0% and 2.5%, driven by higher service prices. Inflation expectations showed a moderate rise, and the underlying CPI is expected to add gradually.

The Bank of England left the benchmark bank rate steady at 4.75% during its December 2024 meeting, in line with market expectations, as CPI inflation, wage growth and some indicators of inflation expectations had risen, adding to the risk of inflation persistence. However, three policymakers preferred to reduce the bank rate by 25bps to 4.5% on the back of sluggish demand and a weakening labour market. The central bank reinforced that a gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint remains appropriate and that monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The central bank will continue to decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.

The Bank of England is widely expected to hold the benchmark bank rate steady at 4.75% during its December 2024 meeting, balancing persistent inflationary pressures against slowing economic growth. After cutting rates twice this year by a total of 50bps, the central bank has been advocating a gradual approach to removing policy restraint. Annual inflation rate in the UK rose for a second month to 2.6% in November as expected. The services inflation steadied at 5%, below forecasts of 5.1% but above the BoE's estimate of 4.9%. Also, wage growth surpassed expectations at 5.2% but the economy contracted 0.1% for a second month in October. Most investors now anticipate the central bank will implement just two rate cuts next year, with the first likely occurring at the February meeting.

The Fed lowered the fed funds rate by 25bps as expected but signalled only 50bps of rate cuts for 2025, half the reduction projected in September, as inflation is seen taking longer than previously anticipated to reach the target.

The UK 10-year gilt yield stands at 4.54%, having climbed 100 bps this year, underperforming US and German counterparts. The Bank of England kept its key interest rate at 4.75% last week, but a surprising vote split, with three policymakers favoring rate cuts, signaled potential faster easing in 2025. This shift reassured bond investors, who had pushed gilt yields higher amid persistent inflation and mounting public debt. The BoE�s cautious stance contrasted with the Fed, which cut rates but signaled only two reductions next year, boosting the dollar and pressuring the pound. Meanwhile, British wage growth accelerated through October, and inflation rose to an eight-month high of 2.6% in November, supporting gradual rate cuts ahead. However, the UK�s economic outlook remains bleak, with GDP flatlining in the third quarter and second-quarter growth revised down to 0.4%, underscoring the challenges faced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer�s new administration.

1;Russia held rates at 21%;"2024-12-20 10:41:15.540000: Bank of Russia Unexpectedly Holds Rate at 21%
The Bank of Russia held its key interest rate unchanged at the record high of 21% in its December meeting, surprising markets that expected a 200bps rate hike to 23%. The decision took place following reports that CBR Governor Nabiullina recently talked with President Putin and Russian business leaders, who have been vocal against high interest rates despite soaring inflation. The central bank cited low credit activity as the warrant for the pause in rate hikes, but reiterated that underlying inflation continued to rise amid higher expectations from households and business, driving the bank�s inflation forecast to rise for 2025 and 2026. The central bank also noted that the significant weakening of the ruble, unbalanced budget spending, and the ongoing labor force crisis contributed to soaring inflation. November data showed that annual headline inflation was at 8.9%, but early forecasts from the CBR have December's print near 9.5%, translating to the highest since February 2023.

The Central Bank of Colombia reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 9.5% in December, less than the expected 50bps reduction, with five board members supporting the move, while one favored a 50bps cut and another a 75bps reduction. Annual inflation eased to 5.2% in November from 5.4% in October, though core inflation held at 5.4% due to persistent service inflation. GDP expanded by 2.0% in Q3, driven by a 20.3% surge in gross capital formation, lifting year-to-date growth to 1.6%. However, recent exchange rate volatility, stemming from tighter global financial conditions, slower expected Fed rate cuts, and Colombia�s fiscal uncertainty, has raised inflationary risks, limiting room for aggressive rate cuts. The labor market remained stable, with unemployment below pre-pandemic levels. The central bank emphasized that future rate decisions will depend on incoming economic data while balancing inflationary pressures and growth recovery.

Despite challenges such as adverse weather affecting prices, inflation is expected to remain stable. The Bank acknowledged risks, such as potential policy changes from Jamaica�s trading partners, but remains committed to keeping inflation low and stable while monitoring the trajectory of future economic conditions.

The Central Bank of Uruguay raised its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points to 8.75% during its December 2024 meeting, reaffirming its goal of achieving inflation convergence toward the 4.5% target within the 24-month Monetary Policy Horizon. Annual inflation was 5.03% in November, maintaining 18 consecutive months within the target range, the longest streak since the inflation-targeting regime began. However, core inflation rose for the second consecutive month, exceeding headline inflation due to higher prices of tradable goods. Globally, advanced economies face slower growth and persistent core inflation. Uruguay's GDP grew 4.1% year-on-year in Q3, with 2024 growth projected at 3.4%. The Central Bank highlighted positive transmission of monetary policy but noted ongoing global uncertainty, reinforcing the need for tighter policy to anchor inflation expectations.

The Central Bank of Turkey cut its benchmark one-week repo auction rate by 250bps to 47.5% in its December 2024 decision, ending the nine-month stretch of borrowing costs at a 14-year high, to mark its first rate cut since a series of unorthodox rate cuts bottomed at 8.5% in February 2023 despite a plunging lira and soaring inflation at the time. This contrasted with the median market expectation of a 150bps cut. In turn, the TCMB narrowed the overnight rate corridor between the lending and borrowing rates to maintain policy restrictive. The Monetary Policy Committee noted that leading indicators suggested that disinflation has continued through the end of the year amid a more apparent moderation in services inflation. The latest data showed that headline inflation slowed to a 17-month low of 47.09%, but the recent rate of decline has eased. Importantly, the central bank also stated that increased coordination with fiscal policy will be done to transmit a restrictive monetary backdrop.

1;Egypt held at 27.25%;"2024-12-26 18:31:37.327000: Egypt Maintains Interest Rate at Record High in December
The Central Bank of Egypt maintained its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 27.25% during its December 2024 meeting, marking ten consecutive months of record-high borrowing costs in the Egyptian monetary system. The move aligns with efforts to control inflation, which declined to 25.5% in November from 26.5% in October, supported by falling food prices and restrictive monetary policies. Core inflation also eased to 23.7% in November from 24.4% in October. Despite these improvements, inflation remains well above the bank's target rate of 7% (�2 percentage points). Heightened geopolitical tensions and fiscal consolidation measures, including higher prices for fuel and other administratively priced items, continue to exert upward pressure on inflation. The CBE extended its inflation target horizon to the fourth quarters of 2026 and 2028, aiming for 7% and 5% on average, respectively, to accommodate price shocks without further tightening.

The Central Bank of Tunisia maintained its key interest rate at 8% on December 28, 2024, the highest level since at least 2006. The decision came amid easing inflation and was consistent with the inflation outlook. Inflation slowed slightly in November to 6.6%, marking the lowest rate since December 2021 due to a slowdown in food and transport prices. Meanwhile, the economy grew 1.8% year-on-year in Q3 of 2024, accelerating from a 1% expansion in the previous quarter, marking the highest growth since Q3 of 2022, mainly boosted by agriculture, forestry & fishing.

1;Dominican Republic lowered to 5.75%;"2024-12-30 19:04:19.817000: Dominican Republic Lowers Interest Rate to 5.75%
The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% during its December 2024 meeting, following a cumulative reduction of 275 basis points since May 2023. The decision reflects favorable international conditions, including rate cuts by major central banks, easing inflationary pressures, and stable commodity prices. Annual inflation stood at 3.18% in November, remaining within the 4.0% � 1.0% target range, while core inflation, at 3.93%, hovered near the midpoint. The Dominican economy grew by 5.1% year-to-date through November and is projected to expand by 5% in 2024, driven by robust performance in tourism, remittances, exports, and foreign investment. To bolster liquidity, the Central Bank has implemented measures, including the release of RD$35.4 billion in legal reserves and the extension of liquidity facilities, providing RD$175 billion in total financial system support.

1;Australia's yield fluctuated, ending at 4.52%;"2024-12-30 04:19:17.430000: Australia 10-Year Bond Yield Rises to Over 1-Month High
Australia�s 10-year government bond yield jumped to around 4.52%, reaching its highest level in over a month. Domestic yields followed the rise in U.S. bond yields, driven by expectations that President-elect Donald Trump's trade and immigration policies would fuel inflation and his proposed tax cuts would add to the U.S. debt burden. Domestically, the Reserve Bank of Australia�s December meeting minutes revealed growing confidence among policymakers in controlling inflation, though ongoing risks were acknowledged. The RBA emphasized the need for a ""sufficiently restrictive"" policy until inflation uncertainty is reduced and the 2�3% target is achieved. The central bank reiterated that bringing inflation back to target is its top priority and stressed a data-driven approach to future rate decisions. Markets imply a split chance that the RBA can lower interest rates by 25 bps at its next meeting in February, while a first easing is more than fully priced in by April.

1;Russia's yield surged to over 15.5%;"2024-12-30 18:48:38.300000: Russian Bond Yields Rise 320bps in 2024
The yield on the Russian 10-year OFZ was over the 15.5% mark at the turn of the year, surging over 320bps since the start of the year amid ample supply of government bonds, lower demand for Russian assets due to sanctions, and an aggressive tightening cycle by the Bank of Russia. Surging inflation due to a plunging ruble, a labor-force crisis, and altered supply chains in response to sanctions drove the central bank to deliver 13.5 percentage points in rate hikes in the year. Throughout policy statements, the central bank noted that expansionary fiscal policy and the large-scale military spending by the Kremlin contributed to inflation in Russia, financed in part through record levels of OFZ issuances through auctions. Still, the yield on OFZs eased through December after the CBR held its key rate in the final meeting of the year instead of market expectations that ranged between 200bps-300bps hikes, amid reports of pressure from the Kremlin and business owners.

1;Canada's yield fell to 3.28%;"2024-12-20 18:06:05.217000: Canada 10-Year Bond Yield Tracks US Yields Lower
Canada�s 10-year government bond yield fell to 3.28%, retreating from a monthly high of 3.345% on December 19, tracking US Treasury yields lower as softer-than-expected US inflation data strengthened the case for further Federal Reserve rate cuts. Domestically, November�s trimmed-mean core inflation held at 2.7%, exceeding the 2.5% forecast, limiting the Bank of Canada�s flexibility to lower rates further and deepening economic headwinds. The government�s fiscal update revised GDP growth projections to 1.7% for 2025 (down from 1.9%) and 2.1% for 2026 (down from 2.2%), reflecting slowing momentum. The BoC�s recent 50bps rate cut to 3.25%, amid rising unemployment and sluggish growth, underscores its challenge in balancing economic stagnation and persistent inflation. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland�s resignation over policy disagreements with Prime Minister Trudeau has amplified uncertainty, given her critical role in managing trade relations and fiscal stability.

Brent crude oil futures rose above $74 per barrel in thin holiday trading, nearing a seven-week high, as traders focused on upcoming US and China economic data to gauge demand in the world�s top oil consumers. Investors are awaiting China�s PMI factory surveys and the US ISM survey for December, with optimism fueled by expectations of stronger Chinese growth in 2025. Additionally, colder-than-usual weather lifted natural gas futures by 20%, potentially driving short-term oil demand. Still, concerns about a 2025 supply glut and geopolitical risks keep the market cautious, with traders also watching the incoming Trump administration for potential impacts on oil policy.

1;gold increased 27% annually;"2024-12-30 13:56:58.280000: Gold Holds Pullback on Hawkish Fed
Gold held below $2,610 per ounce, trimming gains from earlier in the session to trade with limited movement in the past week as investors continued to heed signs of a hawkish Federal Reserve. Resilient labor market data per payroll counts and evidence of stubborn inflation drove FOMC members to project fewer rate cuts by the Fed in 2025, raising the opportunity to hold non-yielding assets and forcing gold prices to a slight loss in Q4. Still, gold is due to end the year 27% higher. The Fed delivered 100bps in interest rate cuts since the start of its cutting cycle, including a 50bps cut in September following a sudden rise in the unemployment rate. Gold was also supported by heightened demand for safe-haven assets throughout the year amid war in Ukraine, Gaza, Lebanon, and missile strikes from Iran. Lastly, gold was lifted by large volumes of central bank buying, led by efforts by the PBoC to stoke up reserves, lifting prices to a record high of $2,790 in September.

1;silver dropped to a three-month low below $29;"2024-12-30 16:10:27.690000: Silver Drops to Over 3-Month Low
Silver eased to below the $29 per ounce mark, the lowest level since September, amid the outlook of a hawkish Fed and uncertain demand for silver�s industrial utility. Concerns of stubborn inflation drove the FOMC to project fewer rate cuts for the upcoming year, driving markets to trim their exposure to non-yielding bullion assets. While the earlier rate cuts by the Fed supported bullion enough to raise silver prices by 23% this year, pessimistic demand for silver as an industrial input drove the metal to sharply underperform gold in the period. Overcapacity in China�s solar panel industry drove photovoltaic companies to sign up for a government self-discipline program that aims to regulate supply, limiting the outlook of silver demand from its top industry. Pressure was also noted from the threat of a yuan devaluation in accordance with China's looser monetary policy stance, lowering asking prices from one of the world's top exporters.
